"""This module contains the functions for converting UVBeam objects to raw data.

This is useful when you want to perform beam interpolation in some other way than
simply with `beam.interp()`. Since this is purely for speed (obviously not for
convenience), this module makes many assumptions and restrictions on the UVBeam objects
that it can handle.

    """Extract raw data from the UVBeam object and prime it for interpolation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uvbeam
        The UVBeam object containing the raw beam data.
    naz
        The desired number of pierce points along the azimuth axis to return.
    dza
        The grid size along the zenith angle axis to return.
    interp_kwargs
        Extra keyword arguments to be passed to the interpolation function.

    Returns
    -------
    beam_data
        The 2D array of beam data on the az/za grid.
    daz
        The grid size along the azimuth direction. The grid always has its first point
        at zero and its last point at 2pi, which means this value must be an integer
        divisor of 2pi.
    daz
        The grid size along the zenith angle direction. The grid always has its first
        point at zero, and its last point is equal to or greater than pi/2 (i.e the
        horizon).

    Notes
    -----
    For this function to work, the UVBeam object must be in the az_za coordinate system
    to begin with. This is because the GPU interpolation functions work only on a
    rectilinear grid of az/za.

    If the raw data in the beam is itself already on a regular az/za grid for which the
    az values go exactly from 0 to 2pi and the za values go from 0 to >=pi/2, then by
    default they are just returned as-is. Otherwise, the intrinsic ``.interp()`` method
    of the UVBeam object is used to interpolate it to a regular grid. Doing the latter
    is "less good" in the sense that it means that two overall spatial interpolations
    will be done when computing visibilities. Since they will both be in the same basis
    set, this should not be a problem (definitely so if the initial interpolation is
    linear).
